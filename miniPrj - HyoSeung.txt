Hi, my name is HyoSeung and this is Vassillen,
we will be presenting our Feature Detection mini project.
 
In our project, we approximate the second fundamental tensor per-vertex
on triangular- 3D meshes based on Szymon's paper which was offered from the lecture.
We use it to compute the principal curvatures and directions, which
we then use to compute the Gaussian curvatures and Mean curvatures.
 
We additionally implemented a part of Meyer's paper in MATLAB which is another
paper from the given references, but eventually opted for the implementation
based on Szymon's paper, since it does not have topological restrictions
such as holes in meshes, so it handles degenerate cases well compared to other methods,
and it can directly operate on vertices and triangles - it is not requiring 
a specialized structure such as the 1-ring neighbourhood. 
The fact that the algortihm can be run per-vertex and per-triangle,
it also makes it highly parallelizable.
 
Our project is implemented in C++ and we have implemented a renderer
using OpenGL in order to visualize our results in real-time; this mainly
benefits the rendering of larger models such as the model with 3.7 million triangles.
For the GUI we have used a third-party library called "Dear ImGUI".

    Motivation  (Page 2)
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The second fundamental form has various applications in Modeling, Rendering,
and Computer Vision. Some of these applications include: surface point classification,
non-photorealistic rendering, feature-preserving denoising, and mesh simplification.
 
Next, Vassillen will go over the algorithmic details for our project.

    Summary at Page 18 (Tweety)
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
To summarize, our project estimates the second fundamental form
per-vertex on a triangular mesh. We compute the principal curvatures and
directions from the tensors. We can visualize all of these, 
including the mean curvatures and gaussian curvatures.

The implemented algorithm is robust to mesh discretization by using
the Voronoi-weights presented in Meyer's paper. Additionally, it can handle
some degenerate cases such as holes in the model. It is also an efficient algorithm
since it does not require a specific data structure, and it formulates per-vertex
and per-triangle.
 
Thanks.
